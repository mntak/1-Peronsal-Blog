            <h3>Doraku Sushi</h3>
                <p>2233 Kalakaua Ave, Royal Hawaiʻian Center, Honolulu
                    808.922.3323</p>
                    <p>
                        The first concept of restaurateur Kevin Aoki, this is a very popular spot — as in lines out the door. It’s also one of our favorite happy hour destinations with an extensive menu featuring hot food, sushi dishes, as well as alcoholic beverages. Doraku’s complex menu consists of both traditional and fusion creations that satisfy both sushi beginners and connoisseurs. Open daily from 11:30am to 10pm. Happy hour is every day 4pm to 6pm.

                   <p>
                    We LOVE the reason this behind this restaurant name — it’s an homage to one of the first restaurants on Oahu. Award-winning chef Roy Yamaguchi honors Hawaii’s history by using the simple flavors of the past in bold modern dishes. Open daily from 4pm to 9pm. Happy hour is daily 4pm to 6pm.
